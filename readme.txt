A WordPress plug-in designed to convert your 404 not found page into a way to help a Compassion child find a sponsor

== Description ==

The goal of this plug-in is to make it easy for someone to implement
the 404gotten.org page not found solution onto their website to help
impoverished children around the world.  Just imagine how you will
feel if even one child is helped because of your efforts.

The HTTP 404 is the error that you see when a link is broken, or you
navigated to web page that just isn't there. It happens, and it's one
of the most common error pages you see.

Note: Activating this plug-in will automatically replace your default
Drupal 404 page. To stop it, simply deactivate.

All of the unsponsored children are served within an iframe pointing to
[404gotten.org](http://404gotten.org). [404gotten.org](http://404gotten.org)
is provided by Compassion International.  Compassion is a leading non-profit
that receives high rankings from leading watch dog organizations like
the Better Business Bureau, Charity Navigator and others.

== Installation ==

There aren't really any special instructions for installing this plug-in. Once
installed, be sure to go to the '404gotten.org' settings page if the 404 page isn't appearing.
This may happen if your webhost serves up their own 404 pages.
