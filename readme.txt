A Wordpress plugin that turns your 404 "not found" error page into a 404 page dedicated to help impoverished children around the world receive sponsorships.

== Description ==

The goal of this plugin is to make is *really* easy for someone on
Wordpress to implement the 404gotten.org not found page onto their website
to help impoverished children around the world receive sponsorships.

The HTTP 404 is the error that you see when a link is broken,
or you navigated to web page that just isn't there. It happens,
and it's one of the most common error pages you see.

Why not help children in need from around the world?

**Note**: Activating this plugin will automatically replace your
default Wordpress 404 page. To stop it, simply deactivate.

All of the missing child notices are served within an iframe
pointing to [404gotten.org](http://404gotten.org).


== Installation ==

There aren't really any special instructions for installing this plug-in. Once
installed, be sure to go to the '404gotten.org' settings page if the 404 page isn't appearing.
This may happen if your webhost serves up their own 404 pages.
